## 1. What is Statistics?
Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing data.

---

## 2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.

**Types of Statistics**

- **Descriptive Statistics →** It consists of organizing and summarizing data
  - Measure of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
  - Measure of dispersion (variance, standard deviation)
  - Different types of distribution of data like histogram, pdf, probability mass function
- **Inferential Statistics →** It consists of using data you have measured to form conclusion
  - Hypothesis testing → z-test, t-test, h0, h1, p value, significance value
  - chi square test

**Example** - There are 20 statistics class at your college and you have collected the heights of students in the class. Heights are recorded in cm as [175, 180, 140, 140, 135, 160, 135, 190]

- What is the average height of the entire class → Descriptive question
- Are the height of the students in the classroom similar to what you expect in the entire college? → Inferential question

## 3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of each type of data.

**Types of data are as follows :**

- **Quantitative data**
  - Discreet → number of bank account, number of children in a family, whole number
  - Continuous → height, weight, temperature, speed
- **Qualitative**
  - Normal → gender, blood group, pincode
  - Ordinal → we rank the data, customer feedback rating

## 4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:

(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E → **Qualitative data(Ordinal)**

(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red→ **Qualitative data (Normal)**

(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...] → **Quantitative data (Continous)**

(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ... → **Quantitative data (Discreet)**

## 5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.

**Different scales of measurement of data are** →

- **Nominal Scale Data**
  - Qualitative or categorical data
  - Order does not matter
  - Eg - gender, colors, labels
- **Ordinal Scale Data**
  - Ranking or order is important
  - Difference cannot be measured.
  - Eg → bad, good and best review
- **Interval Scale Data**
  - The order matters
  - Difference can be measured
  - Ratio cannot be measured
  - No true 0 starting point
  - Eg → temperature
- **Ratio Scale Data**
  - The order matters
  - Difference can be measured
  - Ratio can be measured
  - Eg - student marks in a subject

## 6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.

It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because it determines the type of statistical analysis that can be applied to the data. Different statistical methods are appropriate for different types of data, and using the wrong method can lead to inaccurate results and conclusions.

For example - let's say we are analyzing data on the salaries of employees in a company. We want to determine if there is a significant difference in salaries between different departments.

## 7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type?

- **Nominal Scale Data**
  - Qualitative or categorical data
  - Order does not matter
  - Eg - gender, colors, labels
- **Ordinal Scale Data**
  - Ranking or order is important
  - Difference cannot be measured.
  - Eg → bad, good and best review

## 8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?

Box plots (also known as box-and-whisker plots) are commonly used to display data in terms of range. A box plot provides a visual summary of the distribution of a dataset by showing the median, quartiles, and outliers.

## 9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each type of statistics and explain how they are used

- **Descriptive Statistics →** It consists of organizing and summarizing data
  - Measure of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
  - Measure of dispersion (variance, standard deviation)
  - Different types of distribution of data like histogram, pdf, probability mass function
- **Inferential Statistics →** It consists of using data you have measured to form conclusion
  - Hypothesis testing → z-test, t-test, h0, h1, p value, significance value
  - chi square test

**Example** - There are 20 statistics class at your college and you have collected the heights of students in the class. Heights are recorded in cm as [175, 180, 140, 140, 135, 160, 135, 190]

- What is the average height of the entire class → Descriptive question
- Are the height of the students in the classroom similar to what you expect in the entire college? → Inferential question

## 10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset

Some common measures of central tendency are -

- **Mean**: The mean is the average value of a dataset, calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset is normally distributed, as it is influenced by all values in the dataset. However, it can be sensitive to outliers and may not be representative of the dataset if there are extreme values.

- **Median**: The median is the middle value of a dataset, with half of the values above and half below. The median is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset is skewed or has outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values. It is also a useful measure when the dataset has ordinal or interval data types.

- **Mode**: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset has nominal data types or when we want to know the most commonly occurring value in the dataset.
